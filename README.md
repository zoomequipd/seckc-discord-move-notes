# SecKC Discord Transition Notes
This is a personal record of my experience while moving to the SecKC Discord server coming from a 100% Slack user.  I hope to achieve two goals with this writeup.
1. Create a helpful "cheat sheet" for people moving form Slack to Discord
1. Document the experience so the SecKC Discord Admins can make changes for areas of improvement.
