# SecKC Discord Transition Notes
This is a personal record of my experience while moving to the SecKC Discord server coming from a 100% Slack user.  I 
hope to achieve two goals with this writeup.  
1. Create a helpful "cheat sheet" for people moving form Slack to Discord
1. Document the experience so the SecKC Discord Admins can make changes for areas of improvement.

My experience is with Discord in the browser.  I have not downloaded the app, so that experience might differ from 
what I've documented. 
## Invite
The invite was posted to the #secops channel by Jur1st 
[https://discord.gg/eP6smp](https://discord.gg/eP6smp)

I already had an existing Discord (thanks to DCDarkNet from way back when) account, so sign up was very easy. 

## Initial Greeting
The first thing I was greated with was the "NSFW Channel" warning    
![NSFW Channel Warning](images/nsfw_channel_warning.png)  

I think this might have been a result of the invite being for the #outhouse channel, but I'm not sure.  I don't know 
anything about discord, but this was an odd experience

## Messages Failing To load
At first the images failed to load, this seemed to be a result of UMatrix blocking XHR requests to 12.0.0.1 (Huh?)

I'd not seen this on any other website, and I'm kinda curious what is going on there.

However, allowing these requests did not get the messages to load.

Instead, I had to go to the #rules channel where I was greeted with a Code Of Conduct and had to add an emoji response 
to agree to it?    
That seems lame.  Is this a normal discord thing?

Having added an emoji response, I was granted access to a bunch of channels.

## Sidebar
### Channel Clutter
I found that I _had_ to be in every channel, there was no option to "leave" a channel. There is an option to mute 
specific channels I didn't care about.  

This setup was a bit annoying, where all channels are "Opt-Out", but they still clutter the sidebar.  You can mute 
entire groups of channels, but when I found I only wanted to participate in three channels out of the ten in the group, 
I had to go and mute 7 channels.  A bit annoying to setup compared to Slack's "Opt-In" channel methods.

### Hide Muted Channels
Hiding Muted Channels - Ok, i found that if you right click in an "empty" space of the sidebar, an option to "hide muted channels" appears, this helped declutter my sidebar.

## Channels
### beats-live
I decided to check out the #beats-live channel which is supposed to allow me to listen to some music?   
I can't hear anything when I joined.   

I finally got the nerve up ot ask in the #beats channel and it turns out the music was paused or something.  Triw0lf got me squared away.  I also found [Grovy's Command Guide](https://groovy.bot/commands?category=premium&prefix=-) to be helpful.
